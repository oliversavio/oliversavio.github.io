I'm currently working on architecting and building scalable and fault tolerant data pipelines and platforms. A lot of my work includes working with technologies like Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, Kafka and AWS.

My areas of interest lies in performance engineering and machine learning. 

I blog about things I've learnt and hope to revisit sometime in the future.
